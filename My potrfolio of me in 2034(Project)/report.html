      <h1>Report on my Web Development final term coursework</h1>
      <p class="center">Student: Garry Rubin.</p>
      <p>I would like to present my portfolio web site of me in 10 years. I view myself as an experienced computer scientist, front-end and back-end developer that has also performed his own projects. I am targeting various IT companies that might be interested in employing me.</p>
      <p>The structure of my site is quite clear and minimalistic. The site consists of 5 different pages: main page, blog, my experience and contact information. I have been inspired by several web site portfolios I noticed during my observations. Here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="https://architect-cv.weblium.site/">https://architect-cv.weblium.site/</a></li>
          <li><a href="https://youtube-blogger.weblium.site/">https://youtube-blogger.weblium.site/</a> </li>
          <li><a href="https://www.moritzpetersen.com/">https://www.moritzpetersen.com/</a> </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Mainly I picked up on the layout and positioning elements on the page. Where to place an image or a paragraph etc.
      My web site is accessible in a way that it is responsive to smaller screens. I specifically designed several pages so that they looked nice on a narrow screen. I have also added a sidebar that replaces the main navigation bar on the top when the screen shrinks. It is also responsive to people who may suffer from visual impairment by having a good colour contrast between the text and the background and having a clear simple readable font.</p>
      <p>My site is usable because it has 5 titled different pages which makes it structured and organised. Also, by using Java Script I adjusted some interactivity. I made a responsive navigation bar and an image slider for pictures on one of the pages.</p>
      <p>While building my web site I learned a lot about layout, its special instruments, like flex box and grid box. Also, I learned how to implement Java Script into HTML to add interactivity and responsiveness. And I have gotten better at building the DOM structure of the page and design skills, like applying different fonts, colours etc. All that I achieved by putting my time and effort into the project and watching loads of videos on YouTube, especially about Java Script.</p>
      <p>I think that at my work I did well at structuring my web pages and adding some useful interactivity. I really like my responsive navigation bar and image sliders. Also, I like my design I have implemented: colours, fonts, text-decorations.</p>
      <p>On the other hand, I think that I could improve my layout and positioning. On some pages it is very basic and simple. I could also add more action to appearing the media content, like images sliding on the page. More than that, I probably could simplify my Java Script code. To another developer it may seem to be too overloaded, and there may be an easier solution.</p>
